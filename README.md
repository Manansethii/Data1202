## Project Title

Data Analytics Tools Lab 5: Encoding Categorical Features

### Short description

This project is a part of the Data Analytics Tools course and focuses on learning different techniques to encode categorical features into numerical quantities. The lab demonstrates three methods: replacing values, label encoding, and one-hot encoding, applied to a single column of a dataset. However, the same approaches can be extended to all columns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- pandas
- numpy

### Installing

To install the required libraries, you can use the following commands:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

## Running the Tests

### Breakdown of Tests

The lab consists of three parts:

1. **Replacing Values**: In this part, you'll learn how to replace categorical values with desired numerical values using the `replace()` function in pandas.

2. **Label Encoding**: Here, you'll encode categorical values with numerical labels between 0 and n_categories-1 using the `cat.codes` method.

3. **One-Hot Encoding**: In this part, you'll create a new binary column for each unique category using the `get_dummies()` function in pandas.

## Deployment

This project is a part of a hands-on lab and does not require deployment.
